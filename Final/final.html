<p> I was born and raised in canada by a loving and caring father. They have always been huge influences and
  have always paved the way for me. My father and mother are native to the conitnent of Africa, specifically Ghana.
  The love i feel from my family on a constant bases lights a fire in me, which allows me to push o during tough times.
  I also have a brother who at the age of 22 is my biggest inspiration and has been the one to help me realize my dream of
  being a software developer.

I was born into a family of five with mom, dad, and two siblings </br>
My history and roots come from my family as they were passed on </br>
My background is Sri Lankan; a country that was colonized</br>
Religion is a big part of my culture</br>
The fire that keeps me going are my family and religion </br>
My connection to spirit is deeply associated with my religion beliefs because of my culture
