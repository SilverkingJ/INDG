<h4>South Medicine Wheel</h4>
<div>
<p> I was have been blessed with an abudance of friends in my life. My best friend however has alwaays been in my life, his name is Genesis.
  We were on the same football team in highschool and we often had fun on the feild. My friends would describe me as a warm hearted and out going person
  who loves conversation and discussing life goals. Although my friends are not with me at Brock, i have met and befriended a really good group of friends at
  Brock who i love very dearly. They often push me to finish assignments and attend class, even when im not feeling it. I am thankful for everyone in my life.

<h4>Communitty</h4>
<p> I grew up in a community where everybody knew everbody, often through the neighbourhood basketball courts. Over there friendships were often made.
  The school Cardinal Ambrozic was the hub of the community and was one of two schools the community would go to. I lived in a loving community
 and i wouldnt change that for anything else.

 <p>
   How I view myself? </br>
   My group of friends see me humble, helpful, funny, and positive </br>
   In university, the friendship and community was strong like in first year residence</br>
   The roommates and friends I met in Brock made school an interesting experience</br>
   While I was away from my family attending Brock, it was my roommates and friends who I had at Brock</br>
   They were helpful through the hard times and fun to be with during the easy times
