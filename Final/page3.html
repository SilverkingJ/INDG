<p> I believe in a bright future for myself and love the feild im currently in, i want to be software developer and a web developer.
    I fell in love with this aspect of computers due to my older brothers love of coding and story telling. I would love to tell stories with my creations as that
    is one of the aspects of life i really love and truly cherish. The ability to tell stories, i believe is one of human kinds greatest gifts
    as we are able to convey emotions and our lives through story telling. This class truly helped me because it gave me a new percpective of life, which enables me to create more realistic and great stories.

As mentioned before, I want to become a teacher in the future (elementary & middle school) </br>
I remembered the good teachers I had and wanted to become like them </br>
During volunteering I finally discovered what I wanted to do for my self in the future</br>
Working with kids in help of their future of what they want to pursue</br>
To provide knowledge to students whether it is through the school curriculum or off personal experiences/life lessons</br>
Making my job meaningful by bringing an education to the future students and ensuring them that they leave the school with some knowledge </br>
I also want to provide enjoyable and successful school experiences for kids to have to make them feel included and want to attend to school
