<p>North Game</p>
<p> I stand for creativity and Inclusitivity, As a human i strive to be as creative as possible and always be proud of the work i do. In terms
  of inclusivity I want to create stories that include many different races and cultures. My motivation in life is seeing my parents happy and proud
  of me.</p>
<h4> Mayos North</h4>
  <p>
    What I stand for is to try make a difference and contribute something meaningful to the world or society for a purpose </br>
   Whether it is teaching the future generations with my career or building a school in a developing country, that would make me satisfied </br>
   I believe that kids should be educated so that they have some knowledge and use it to their possible advantages and become a strong individual </br>
   This is what drives me to becoming a future teacher </br>
   I also believe that empowering and supporting these kids in the making for the future is important so that they can become a big figure for the future society/generations. These future students can end up growing to whatever they want to be with the knowledge they possess and chase their dreams/future ambitions for the next era. </br>

  <h4> TRC calls to action</h4>
  <p>Sports and reconcilliation</p>
  <p>We call upon all levels of government, in collaboration with aboriginal peoples, sports halls of fame, and other relevant organizations, to provide public education
    that tells the national story of aboriginal athletes in history.
  </p>

  <h4> Mayos TRC calls to action</h4>
  <p>For Education</p>
  <p> 62. We call upon the federal, provincial, and territorial governments, in consultation and collaboration with Survivors, Aboriginal peoples, and educators, to: </br> </br>
i. Make age-appropriate curriculum on residential schools, Treaties, and Aboriginal peoplesâ€™ historical and contemporary contributions to Canada a mandatory education requirement for Kindergarten to Grade Twelve students. </br></br>
ii. Provide the necessary funding to post-secondary institutions to educate teachers on how to integrate Indigenous knowledge and teaching methods into classrooms. </br></br>
iii. Provide the necessary funding to Aboriginal schools to utilize Indigenous knowledge and teaching methods in classrooms. </br></br>
iv. Establish senior-level positions in government at the assistant deputy minister level or higher dedicated to Aboriginal content in education </br></br>
Incorporating indigenous culture, history and other subjects in classroom is essential </br></br>
Including indigenous studies in the curriculum and teaching who they are would make students recognize who the first inhabitants of the nation are</br></br>
Even practicing activities relating to Indigenous culture such as class circles would be a start </br></br>
In the end, it is all about inclusiveness and changing the Westernized dominant curriculum
